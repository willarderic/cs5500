Compilers HW 7 Assignment

Unfortunately, many things turned out to be a lot more work than we thought, and we were unable to finish everything.

What we finished:
 - Arithmetic
 - While loops 
 - Procedures (non-recursive)
 - If statements
 - Output (sort of)
 - Rel Ops
 
All Arithmetic works
Procedures we were unable to get to work recursively, and I think there was a problem with procedures in procedures.
If statements only worked with Rel ops (putting true or false as the condition won't work, needs to be like x > 1) and nested if statements didn't work
Output prints characters (it puts a newline after every character instead of using \ as a newline though)
Output prints integers and negative integers if they are palindromes (it prints out the reverse of the number couldn't figure out why. So single digit and palindromic numbers work fine though :D )
Rel Ops work in the while loop and if statement conditions

Also we can't figure out how to redirect the output of the executable file running.
We tried redirecting using '>', '&>', '2>&1' which covers stdout and stderr, so we apologize but you are going to have to check the output vs the output files.
